# mushroom_classification
In this project, the mushrooms are classified on the basis whether they are edilbe or poisonous.I used Random forest classifier model and trained that model using the mushroom datapoints.
I used Label Encoder to convert the categorical data into numerical representation. I built web application using django framework and mounted my model.
